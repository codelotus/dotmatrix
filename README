My dot files based off of hashrockets and what I learned from peepcode's two "smashing into vim" video tutorials

Note... (taken from http://gist.github.com/398996)
If you are using rvm for to manage your rubies (as you should) and you want ruby interopt in macvim,
grab this fork of macvim: http://github.com/koudelka/macvim and compile with the following options:
./configure --with-features=huge --enable-rubyinterp --with-macsdk=10.6 --with-macarchs=x86_64 --with-ruby-command=ruby
this will use whatever rvm ruby is your --default

Two things remain to be done...
1) grok .hashrc and personalize
2) set up a way to automatically install FuzzyFinder

== Steps to install Fuzzy Finder
* Download fuzzy-finder 2.22.3
* unzip its contents in the ~/.vim dir
* gem install (global) fuzzy_file_finder -v=1.0.4
* inside ~/.vim gem unpack fuzzy_file_finder
* mkdir ~/.vim/ruby
* cp fuzzy_file_finder-1.0.4/lib/fuzzy_file_finder.rb ruby
* download github.com/airblade/fuzzyfinder_textmate/fuzzyfinder_textmate.vim
* copy downloaded file to ~/.vim/plugin
* add 'map <Leader>t :FuzzyFinderTextMate<Enter>' to .vimrc
* in mvim \tFuzzyFinderTextMate to launch
