My dot files based off of hashrockets and what I learned from peepcode's two "smashing into vim" video tutorials

Note... (taken from http://gist.github.com/398996)
If you are using rvm for to manage your rubies (as you should) and you want ruby interopt in macvim,
you will need to compile macvim with the following options:
./configure --with-features=huge --enable-rubyinterp --with-macsdk=10.6 --with-macarchs=x86_64 --with-ruby-command=ruby
this will use whatever rvm ruby is your --default

Two things remain to be done...
1) grok .hashrc and personalize
